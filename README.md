Deezer-Playlist-Generator 

DeezerPlaylistGenerator is a Java program that utilizes the Deezer API to create custom playlists of songs by user-specified artists. It provides a GUI interface for users to input artist names 
and playlist settings, and returns a .txt file containing a list of songs that match the user's criteria.

The program is built using Java and utilizes the Deezer Java Client Library to interface with the Deezer API. It leverages Deezer's search functionality to query the database for tracks by the specified artists, 
and uses a combination of popularity, genre, and other criteria to filter the results.
